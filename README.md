# SafeCoin
Chrome extension This extension checks the domain you're on, and validates it with a whitelist and a blacklist of domains related to cryptocurrency.


<h2>Get an extra layer of security, and stay safe from phising sites</h2>
<p>We keep a list of safe domains as well as a list of known phising sites, and display banners and popos everytime the extension recognizes a domain.</p>

<p>Don't forget to help by sending more websites, either to report them or to flag them as safe, by hitting the extension icon on the upper rigt corner of your browser</p>
